```{r}
library(ggplot2)
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
head(choco)
ratings <- choco$Rating
hist(ratings)

```

It appears from the histogram that most ratings are in the 2-4 range, with very few being given a perfect 5 rating.

```{r}
pct <- choco$Cocoa.Pct
plot(pct, ratings, main="Ratings vs. Cocoa Pct.", xlab="% Cocoa", ylab="Rating")

```

Although this scatterplot isn't entirely useful, you can see that there is a fairly box-like shape in the middle. Due to its relative symmetry, it is reasonable to say that the rating does not necessarily depend on the cacao percentage, as there are a wide range of ratings for each percentage.
